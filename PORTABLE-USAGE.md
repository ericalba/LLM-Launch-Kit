# 🧳 Portable Usage Guide - Take Your AI Anywhere!

## The "Coworker's Mac" Scenario

**YES!** It really is that easy. Here's exactly what happens when you plug your ROCKET nano into any Mac:

### What You Need On Your External Drive:
```
/Volumes/ROCKET-nano/
├── LLM Launch Kit - GitHub Version/  ← This folder with all scripts
└── AI-Models/                        ← Your models (created automatically)
    ├── ollama-models/               ← All your Ollama models
    ├── lm-studio-models/            ← All your LM Studio models  
    └── shared-converted/            ← Any shared/converted models
```

### The Magic 30-Second Setup:

```bash
# 1. Plug in your ROCKET nano drive
# 2. Open Terminal on your coworker's Mac
# 3. Navigate to your scripts on the drive:
cd /Volumes/ROCKET-nano/LLM\ Launch\ Kit\ -\ GitHub\ Version/

# 4. Run the portable setup (this does EVERYTHING):
./portable-setup.sh

# 5. That's it! Your models are now accessible on their Mac
```

## What `portable-setup.sh` Does Automatically:

1. **🔍 Auto-detects** your drive name (ROCKET-nano)
2. **✅ Checks** if Ollama/Docker/LM Studio are installed on their Mac
3. **🔧 Creates** a temporary launcher configured for their system
4. **🔗 Sets up** symbolic links pointing to your external drive
5. **📋 Shows** how many models you have available
6. **🚀 Launches** the AI manager immediately

## Real-World Example:

**At your coworker's desk:**
```bash
alba$ cd /Volumes/ROCKET-nano/LLM\ Launch\ Kit\ -\ GitHub\ Version/
alba$ ./portable-setup.sh

🚀 LLM Launch Kit - Portable Setup
Running from external drive - Setting up on this Mac...

🔍 Detected Configuration:
   External Drive: ROCKET-nano
   Drive Path: /Volumes/ROCKET-nano
   Script Location: /Volumes/ROCKET-nano/LLM Launch Kit - GitHub Version

🔍 Checking for required applications...
✅ Ollama: Found
✅ Docker: Found  
✅ LM Studio: Found

🔧 Creating temporary launcher for this Mac...
✅ Temporary launcher created: /tmp/llm-launch-ROCKET-nano.sh

🔗 Setting up symbolic links to your external drive models...
   ✅ Ollama models linked successfully
   ✅ LM Studio models linked successfully

🎉 Portable setup complete!
📋 Found 23 Ollama model files on your drive

Launch the AI manager now? (Y/n): y
🚀 Launching LLM Manager...
```

**Then immediately:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           🚀 LLM LAUNCHER 🚀           ║
║    Universal AI Models Manager        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

✅ External drive connected and models accessible
💾 Drive space: 234GB available (76% used)

📋 Current Ollama Models:
   • llama3.2:latest (2.0GB) - Modified: 2 days ago
   • qwen2.5:7b (4.1GB) - Modified: 1 week ago
   • deepseek-r1:latest (1.8GB) - Modified: 3 days ago
   • codellama:latest (3.8GB) - Modified: 1 week ago

🎯 What would you like to launch?
1️⃣  Ollama Only
2️⃣  Ollama + OpenWebUI  
3️⃣  LM Studio
...
```

## Prerequisites on the Target Mac:

The other Mac just needs these apps installed (one-time setup):
- **Ollama** (`brew install ollama`)
- **Docker Desktop** (from docker.com)
- **LM Studio** (optional, from lmstudio.ai)

## What Happens When You Leave:

```bash
# When you're done, just unplug your drive
# The symbolic links break (that's normal and expected)
# Your models and scripts stay safe on your external drive
# No traces left on their Mac (except maybe some Docker containers)
```

## Benefits:

✅ **Zero setup time** on any Mac with the apps installed  
✅ **All your models** instantly available  
✅ **No downloads** needed - everything runs from your drive  
✅ **Clean departure** - unplug and leave no traces  
✅ **Your configurations** travel with you  
✅ **Same experience** everywhere  

## Use Cases:

- **🏢 Office visits** - Use your models on work computers
- **🏠 Multiple Macs** - Home iMac, work MacBook, etc.
- **👥 Collaboration** - Share your curated model collection
- **🎓 Teaching/Demos** - Bring your setup to presentations
- **🚀 Development** - Consistent AI environment anywhere

## Pro Tips:

1. **Keep apps updated** on Macs you use frequently
2. **Large models** might take a moment to load initially
3. **Docker containers** created on one Mac work on others
4. **OpenWebUI data** can be stored on external drive too (advanced setup)
5. **Your drive becomes** your portable AI workstation!
